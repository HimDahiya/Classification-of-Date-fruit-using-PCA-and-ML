#Principal Component Analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) stands as a multivariate technique, serving as a standard tool in contemporary data analysis to simplify intricate datasets. Founded on linear correlation, PCA transforms original variables into new, uncorrelated variables. This study employs PCA on a dataset centered around date fruits, aiming to reduce feature dimensions for the classification of various date fruit types. The world boasts a multitude of fruits, each exhibiting diverse types. Distinguishing between types of the same fruit based on appearance alone proves time and labor-intensive. The report introduces three widely-used classifiers—Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbours, and Decision Tree—applied to the dataset. The metric for evaluating each model's performance is the F1-score. Additionally, the report includes confusion matrices and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. As an supplementary aspect, renowned classifiers undergo application on the date set, utilizing an advanced Python Library (PyCaret) to discern the optimal model.
